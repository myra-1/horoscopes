Don\u2019t lecture them Virgo! Strive to help them in a sensitive and compassionate way. But expect a turbulent financial week, as the planets shake up your previous expectations. Time to reformulate your fiscal plans! When it comes to work and business, it\u2019s much better to under-promise and over-deliver."

However, disagreeable encounters must now be defused with wisdom and restraint. If you tackle a long-standing moral question, you\u2019ll find that your views have changed.\r\n\r\n(Courtsey: Peter Vidal)"

The more humble and honest you are, the better the week will be. But you should certainly express your adventurous side, as you make a leap of faith or take a smart calculated risk.

You\u2019re in a hurry to get ahead but be especially cautious when it comes to your social circle.

    "content": "With so many planets in Pisces and Aries, being flexible and fast is the key to a successful week. If you are too stubborn and unyielding in your opinions, then others will just stop listening to what you have to say. And if you are too slow off the mark [and hesitant to take action] then others will streak ahead of you, especially at work. So your motivation motto is from fellow Taurean, actress Shirley MacLaine \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to go out on a limb. It\u2019s where all the fruit is.\u201d"

Work relationships will be unpredictable and loved ones disruptive, so revise your expectations and just take things as they come.

Trying to control your timetable [or impose it on others] will just frustrate everyone and get you nowhere fast. So consider swapping Scorpio stubbornness, sarcasm or sulking for cool, clever compromise. If you\u2019re still feeling unsettled then meditation, yoga or some other form of quiet contemplation will help calm you down, as you go with the celestial flow and listen to the wise voice within."

Your ruler Uranus sends disruptions in your direction, plus Jupiter demands that you stop being stubborn and start being more adventurous. So the only certainty at the moment is change. You\u2019re feeling ridiculously restless but try to modify your reactions, otherwise it will be a long and tiring week.

And if you are too bossy with an Aries, Leo or Sagittarian, then an explosive power struggle is likely. You\u2019re brimming over with information and ideas, and are keen to teach or instruct others. But don\u2019t assume you have all the answers. Smart-aleck hubris will just put others off. So strive to be much more inclusive and consultative."

Enthusiasm is high but don\u2019t jump to hasty conclusions, and then pass on incorrect information. Get the facts straight, otherwise embarrassing mix-ups are likely [especially involving family or friends]. Do your best to channel excess energy into a challenging project that is ambitious and adventurous but also realistic."
